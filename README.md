# NovoBot Legacy Source Code
Source code for some parts of the legacy version of NovoBot and NovoBot Nightly.

Please don't just copy the code from here and call it your own. This repository is for learning purposes (mostly so you can learn how *not* to code because me from 5 years ago certainly liked using single letter variables a lot).
